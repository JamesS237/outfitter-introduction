# It works well: What should I wear?
"I still don't know what to wear!" I hear you cry! Have no fear, Outfitter is here!

Outfitter takes many things into account, such as the weather where you are, how much your friends like your outfits, among many
others chosen by you, including tags

Then, each morning, it can give you a recommendation on what to wear, that *hopefully* should be just right.

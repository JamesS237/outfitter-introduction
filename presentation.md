## We are sharing more media than ever before, and we do it every second of every day

 *** 
## And with the both the fashion and social media industry booming, why isn't there a good way to mix them together?

 *** 
## Introducing __Outfitter__, the app that hopes to be __*the*__ social network for the fashion industry, with a few tricks up it's sleeve.

 *** 
# Why Outfitter?
1. Works Well
2. Works Fast
3. Works Everywhere

 *** 
# It works well:
Outfitter has a *ton* of features that every user will benefit from, no matter if they're a fashionista, a casual dresser, or anywhere in between.

 *** 
# It works well: Terminology
To start off, let's introduce you to the basic terminology:
*Wardrobe*: Your wardrobe holds all your clothes and outfits

*Item*: An item is just an item of clothing (represented by a picture you take)

*Outfit*: An arrangement of items that make up an outfit.

 *** 
# It works well: Tagging
Each outfit can be tagged. For example, some outfits might be tagged "hot", others "cold",
some may be tagged "casual", others "smart". (You can organize them however you please)

This fits in with a couple of other cool features, you'll see how it fits in with the rest of Outfitter in a minute.

 *** 
# It works well: Let's get social!
Now that we have our outfits together, we can share them with whoever you choose!

Each a post contains an outfit and a description. They can be liked, commented on, added to your favorites and reposted to share them with others.

 *** 
# It works well: What should I wear?
"I still don't know what to wear!" I hear you cry! Have no fear, Outfitter is here!

Outfitter takes many things into account, such as the weather where you are, how much your friends like your outfits, among many
others chosen by you, including tags

Then, each morning, it can give you a recommendation on what to wear, that *hopefully* should be just right.

 *** 
# It works well: What's cool?
The fashion world is always changing, and a lot of the time it's hard to keep up.

Outfitter knows how to deal with this: It can tell you what's cool and trendy, as well as finding stuff that matches your interests.
It's also build so that it lets the average user have a post become as popular as a "big" user's post

 *** 
# It works fast

Outfitter works fast. It's been built to be fast, and it's sure to not keep you waiting.

 *** 
# It works everywhere
Outfitter runs everywhere you'd expect. Including all Apple, Android and Windows Phone devices, as well as via the web.

 *** 
# Is it profitable?
Yes, we think it is.

Examples of monetization:
- Sponsored users/posts (makes sure they reach users, and that it makes it easy to find where to buy them)
- Subscriptions for the Recommendations (users may pay a monthly fee for outfit recommendation, with a free trial offered)

 *** 
# Things that could be added in the future:
Outfits and clothing items should be shareable not only by "reposting", but also by direct messaging. Again, emphasizing on the social aspect of fashion, in the sense of sharing "tips and tricks".

Linking into "partner" fashion stores: Allowing outfits to be linked with items in online stores to buy the items, and the cart/payment/etc is managed externally

 *** 
# What we need
Currently, Outfitter is just a prototype, and we need your help to make it a reality. We need to do market research, case studies, surveys, and more just to get a proof of concept.

With your help, we can make Outfitter a reality.

# Thank you for your time, and I hope this presentation has given you an insight into Outfitter, and (hopefully) how it can give people a hand with fashion.

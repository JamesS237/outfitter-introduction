# Things that could be added in the future:
Outfits and clothing items should be shareable not only by "reposting", but also by direct messaging. Again, emphasizing on the social aspect of fashion, in the sense of sharing "tips and tricks".

Linking into "partner" fashion stores: Allowing outfits to be linked with items in online stores to buy the items, and the cart/payment/etc is managed externally

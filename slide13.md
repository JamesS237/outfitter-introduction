# It works well: Tagging
Each outfit can be tagged. For example, some outfits might be tagged "hot", others "cold",
some may be tagged "casual", others "smart". (You can organize them however you please)

This fits in with a couple of other cool features, you'll see how it fits in with the rest of Outfitter in a minute.
